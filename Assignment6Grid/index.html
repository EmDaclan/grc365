		<p> College can be confusing, lonely, and stressful as students navigate new life changes, increased responsibilities, their future paths, and their purpose in life. However, these challenges can be addressed with a supportive community that helps each student in their unique journey. Other Christian students and alumni come together for meals, discover more about God through Bible studies, worship together, and even engage in everyday tasks. These fellowships love God and care for their communities!</p>
